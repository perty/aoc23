# Advent of code 2023

## Introduction

Using AI, I will solve the Advent of Code 2023. Perhaps not.

Language: Java.

IDE: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ and Cursor.

## Day 1

I had some problems with understanding the specification, it was a bit vague on what to do when the digits written as words overlapped, eg "eightwo". Not until I read on Reddit that both eight and two should be counted did I understand that I had made the opposite assumption.

Naturally, when I misunderstood the specification, the AI did the same.

I had a try with Cursor, but it was a disappointment. GitHub Copilot results in less amount of clicks to change the code. I would have expected the opposite.

## Day 2

The first part was solved by Github Copilot without changes. I just copied the description and it worked.

The second part was solved by Github Copilo as well, straight off. I am impressed.
