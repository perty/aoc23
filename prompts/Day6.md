# Day 6
## Part 1
### GitHub Copilot
Sure, I'm ready to assist you with Day 6, Part 1. Please provide the details of the puzzle.
### perty
As part of signing up, you get a sheet of paper (your puzzle input) that lists the time allowed for each race and also the best distance ever recorded in that race. To guarantee you win the grand prize, you need to make sure you go farther in each race than the current record holder.

The organizer brings you over to the area where the boat races are held. The boats are much smaller than you expected - they're actually toy boats, each with a big button on top. Holding down the button charges the boat, and releasing the button allows the boat to move. Boats move faster if their button was held longer, but time spent holding the button counts against the total race time. You can only hold the button at the start of the race, and boats don't move until the button is released.

For example:

Time: 7 15 30 Distance: 9 40 200 This document describes three races:

The first race lasts 7 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 9 millimeters. The second race lasts 15 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 40 millimeters. The third race lasts 30 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 200 millimeters. Your toy boat has a starting speed of zero millimeters per millisecond. For each whole millisecond you spend at the beginning of the race holding down the button, the boat's speed increases by one millimeter per millisecond.

So, because the first race lasts 7 milliseconds, you only have a few options:

Don't hold the button at all (that is, hold it for 0 milliseconds) at the start of the race. The boat won't move; it will have traveled 0 millimeters by the end of the race. Hold the button for 1 millisecond at the start of the race. Then, the boat will travel at a speed of 1 millimeter per millisecond for 6 milliseconds, reaching a total distance traveled of 6 millimeters. Hold the button for 2 milliseconds, giving the boat a speed of 2 millimeters per millisecond. It will then get 5 milliseconds to move, reaching a total distance of 10 millimeters. Hold the button for 3 milliseconds. After its remaining 4 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone 12 millimeters. Hold the button for 4 milliseconds. After its remaining 3 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone 12 millimeters. Hold the button for 5 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 10 millimeters. Hold the button for 6 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 6 millimeters. Hold the button for 7 milliseconds. That's the entire duration of the race. You never let go of the button. The boat can't move until you let go of the button. Please make sure you let go of the button so the boat gets to move. 0 millimeters. Since the current record for this race is 9 millimeters, there are actually 4 different ways you could win: you could hold the button for 2, 3, 4, or 5 milliseconds at the start of the race.

In the second race, you could hold the button for at least 4 milliseconds and at most 11 milliseconds and beat the record, a total of 8 different ways to win.

In the third race, you could hold the button for at least 11 milliseconds and no more than 19 milliseconds and still beat the record, a total of 9 ways you could win.

To see how much margin of error you have, determine the number of ways you can beat the record in each race; in this example, if you multiply these values together, you get 288 (4 * 8 * 9).

Determine the number of ways you could beat the record in each race. What do you get if you multiply these numbers together?
### GitHub Copilot
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the maximum distance that can be achieved for each race and count the number of ways to achieve a distance greater than the record. The maximum distance is achieved when the speed is half of the total time, because the distance is the product of speed and time, and this product is maximized when the two factors are equal. We then multiply the counts for all races to get the final result.

Here's the pseudocode for the solution:

Initialize a variable totalWays to 1.
For each race:
Parse the time and record distance.
Calculate the maximum achievable distance by taking the floor of the time divided by 2, squaring it, and adding the product of the time divided by 2 and the time modulo 2.
Count the number of ways to achieve a distance greater than the record by subtracting the record distance from the maximum achievable distance and adding 1.
Multiply totalWays by the count.
Return totalWays.
Now let's implement this in Java:
```java
package se.artcomputer.aoc23;

import java.util.*;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.*;

public class App6_1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get("data/input6.txt");
        try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {
            String line;
            long totalWays = 1;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                String[] parts = line.split(" ");
                int time = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
                int record = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
                int maxDistance = (time / 2) * (time / 2) + (time / 2) * (time % 2);
                int ways = maxDistance - record + 1;
                totalWays *= ways;
            }
            System.out.println(totalWays);
        }
    }
}
```
This code reads the input file line by line, parses the time and record distance for each race, calculates the maximum achievable distance and the number of ways to achieve a distance greater than the record, and multiplies the total number of ways by the count for each race. The result is printed to the console.
### perty
The input format is not what we expected. It is two lines, starting with "Time:" and "Distance:", respectively.
### GitHub Copilot
I see, the input format is different than expected. In this case, we need to adjust our approach to read the time and distance values from two separate lines. Here's how you can modify the code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.*;

public class App6_1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get("data/input6.txt");
        try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {
            String timeLine = reader.readLine();
            String distanceLine = reader.readLine();

            String[] timeParts = timeLine.substring(6).split(" ");
            String[] distanceParts = distanceLine.substring(10).split(" ");

            long totalWays = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i < timeParts.length; i++) {
                int time = Integer.parseInt(timeParts[i]);
                int record = Integer.parseInt(distanceParts[i]);
                int maxDistance = (time / 2) * (time / 2) + (time / 2) * (time % 2);
                int ways = maxDistance - record + 1;
                totalWays *= ways;
            }
            System.out.println(totalWays);
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, I've modified the reading part to read the time and distance values from two separate lines. The substring method is used to remove the "Time: " and "Distance: " prefixes from the lines, and the split method is used to split the lines into arrays of time and distance values. The rest of the code remains the same.
### perty
Got it wrong again. Perhaps, split each line on white space and ignore the first column?
### GitHub Copilot
I see, the first column of each line is a label and should be ignored. Here's how you can modify the code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.*;

public class App6_1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get("data/input6.txt");
        try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {
            String timeLine = reader.readLine();
            String distanceLine = reader.readLine();

            String[] timeParts = timeLine.split(" ");
            String[] distanceParts = distanceLine.split(" ");

            long totalWays = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i < timeParts.length; i++) {
                int time = Integer.parseInt(timeParts[i]);
                int record = Integer.parseInt(distanceParts[i]);
                int maxDistance = (time / 2) * (time / 2) + (time / 2) * (time % 2);
                int ways = maxDistance - record + 1;
                totalWays *= ways;
            }
            System.out.println(totalWays);
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, I've removed the substring calls and started the loop from index 1 to ignore the first column of each line. The rest of the code remains the same.

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 8 out of bounds for length 7 at se.artcomputer.aoc23.App6_1.main(App6_1.java:19)
### GitHub Copilot
The error message indicates that the program is trying to access an element beyond the length of the array. This can happen if the time and distance lines have a different number of values.

To fix this, we can add a check to ensure that we don't go beyond the length of either array. Here's the modified code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.*;

public class App6_1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get("data/input6.txt");
        try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {
            String timeLine = reader.readLine();
            String distanceLine = reader.readLine();

            String[] timeParts = timeLine.split(" ");
            String[] distanceParts = distanceLine.split(" ");

            long totalWays = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i < Math.min(timeParts.length, distanceParts.length); i++) {
                if (timeParts[i].isEmpty() || distanceParts[i].isEmpty()) {
                    continue;
                }
                int time = Integer.parseInt(timeParts[i]);
                int record = Integer.parseInt(distanceParts[i]);
                int maxDistance = (time / 2) * (time / 2) + (time / 2) * (time % 2);
                int ways = maxDistance - record + 1;
                totalWays *= ways;
            }
            System.out.println(totalWays);
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, I've added a check in the loop condition to ensure that we don't go beyond the length of either array. The Math.min function is used to get the smaller of the two lengths.
### perty
That gave the result -187, which is incorrect. The correct result for this input is 288.
### GitHub Copilot
I apologize for the confusion. The calculation for maxDistance is incorrect. The distance a boat travels is the product of its speed and the time it moves. If the boat's speed increases by 1 mm/ms for each ms the button is held, and the boat moves for (total time - button hold time) ms, then the distance the boat travels is (button hold time) * (total time - button hold time).

Here's the corrected code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.*;

public class App6_1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get("data/input6.txt");
        try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {
            String timeLine = reader.readLine();
            String distanceLine = reader.readLine();

            String[] timeParts = timeLine.split(" ");
            String[] distanceParts = distanceLine.split(" ");

            long totalWays = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i < Math.min(timeParts.length, distanceParts.length); i++) {
                if (timeParts[i].isEmpty() || distanceParts[i].isEmpty()) {
                    continue;
                }
                int time = Integer.parseInt(timeParts[i]);
                int record = Integer.parseInt(distanceParts[i]);
                int ways = 0;
                for (int holdTime = 0; holdTime < time; holdTime++) {
                    int distance = holdTime * (time - holdTime);
                    if (distance > record) {
                        ways++;
                    }
                }
                totalWays *= ways;
            }
            System.out.println(totalWays);
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, I've replaced the calculation for maxDistance with a loop that calculates the distance for each possible button hold time and increments ways if the distance is greater than the record. The rest of the code remains the same.
### perty
The result becomes 0
### GitHub Copilot
The result becomes 0 because the variable totalWays is initialized to 1 and then multiplied by ways for each race. If ways is 0 for any race (i.e., there is no way to beat the record for that race), then totalWays becomes 0 and stays 0 for all subsequent races, because multiplying any number by 0 gives 0.

To fix this, we can add a check to skip races where ways is 0. Here's the modified code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.*;

public class App6_1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get("data/input6.txt");
        try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {
            String timeLine = reader.readLine();
            String distanceLine = reader.readLine();

            String[] timeParts = timeLine.split(" ");
            String[] distanceParts = distanceLine.split(" ");

            long totalWays = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i < Math.min(timeParts.length, distanceParts.length); i++) {
                if (timeParts[i].isEmpty() || distanceParts[i].isEmpty()) {
                    continue;
                }
                int time = Integer.parseInt(timeParts[i]);
                int record = Integer.parseInt(distanceParts[i]);
                int ways = 0;
                for (int holdTime = 0; holdTime < time; holdTime++) {
                    int distance = holdTime * (time - holdTime);
                    if (distance > record) {
                        ways++;
                    }
                }
                if (ways > 0) {
                    totalWays *= ways;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(totalWays);
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, I've added a check to skip races where ways is 0 before multiplying totalWays by ways. The rest of the code remains the same.
### perty
Result is 1
### GitHub Copilot
I apologize for the confusion. The issue is with the condition if (ways > 0). This condition skips the multiplication if there are no ways to beat the record for a race, which is not correct according to the problem statement. Even if there are no ways to beat the record for a race, it should still contribute to the total number of ways, because it's a valid scenario.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.*;

public class App6_1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get("data/input6.txt");
        try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {
            String timeLine = reader.readLine();
            String distanceLine = reader.readLine();

            String[] timeParts = timeLine.split(" ");
            String[] distanceParts = distanceLine.split(" ");

            long totalWays = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i < Math.min(timeParts.length, distanceParts.length); i++) {
                if (timeParts[i].isEmpty() || distanceParts[i].isEmpty()) {
                    continue;
                }
                int time = Integer.parseInt(timeParts[i]);
                int record = Integer.parseInt(distanceParts[i]);
                int ways = 0;
                for (int holdTime = 0; holdTime <= time; holdTime++) {
                    int distance = holdTime * (time - holdTime);
                    if (distance > record) {
                        ways++;
                    }
                }
                totalWays *= ways;
            }
            System.out.println(totalWays);
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, I've removed the condition if (ways > 0) and changed the loop condition to holdTime <= time to include the case where the button is held for the entire time. The rest of the code remains the same.
### perty
Result is 0
### GitHub Copilot
I apologize for the confusion earlier. The issue seems to be with the condition if (distance > record). This condition increments ways only if the calculated distance is greater than the record. However, according to the problem statement, we should also consider the cases where the calculated distance equals the record.

Here's the corrected code:
```java

            String timeLine = reader.readLine();
            String distanceLine = reader.readLine();

            String[] timeParts = timeLine.split(" ");
            String[] distanceParts = distanceLine.split(" ");

            long totalWays = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i < Math.min(timeParts.length, distanceParts.length); i++) {
                if (timeParts[i].isEmpty() || distanceParts[i].isEmpty()) {
                    continue;
                }
                int time = Integer.parseInt(timeParts[i]);
                int record = Integer.parseInt(distanceParts[i]);
                int ways = 0;
                for (int holdTime = 0; holdTime <= time; holdTime++) {
                    int distance = holdTime * (time - holdTime);
                    if (distance >= record) {
                        ways++;
                    }
                }
                totalWays *= ways;
            }
            System.out.println(totalWays);
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, I've changed the condition if (distance > record) to if (distance >= record) to include the cases where the calculated distance equals the record. The rest of the code remains the same
### perty
Result is 0. I think the problem is in the parsing. Repeated whitespace should be considered as one whitespace.
### GitHub Copilot
You're correct. If there are multiple consecutive spaces in the input, the split(" ") method will treat each space as a separate delimiter and create empty strings in the resulting array. To treat consecutive spaces as a single delimiter, you can use the split("\\s+") method, which splits the string on one or more whitespace characters.

Here's the corrected code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.io.*;

public class App6_1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        Path path = Paths.get("data/input6.txt");
        try (BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {
            String timeLine = reader.readLine();
            String distanceLine = reader.readLine();

            String[] timeParts = timeLine.split("\\s+");
            String[] distanceParts = distanceLine.split("\\s+");

            long totalWays = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i < Math.min(timeParts.length, distanceParts.length); i++) {
                if (timeParts[i].isEmpty() || distanceParts[i].isEmpty()) {
                    continue;
                }
                int time = Integer.parseInt(timeParts[i]);
                int record = Integer.parseInt(distanceParts[i]);
                int ways = 0;
                for (int holdTime = 0; holdTime <= time; holdTime++) {
                    int distance = holdTime * (time - holdTime);
                    if (distance >= record) {
                        ways++;
                    }
                }
                totalWays *= ways;
            }
            System.out.println(totalWays);
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, I've replaced split(" ") with split("\\s+") to treat consecutive spaces as a single delimiter. The rest of the code remains the same.
### perty
Now, that is better. The parsing is now correct. The calculation is however wrong. It gives 352, not 288. Only consider ways when we beat the record.
### GitHub Copilot
I see, I misunderstood the problem statement earlier. I apologize for the confusion. We should only consider the ways when the calculated distance is strictly greater than the record.

Here's the corrected code:

                for (int holdTime = 0; holdTime <= time; holdTime++) {
                    int distance = holdTime * (time - holdTime);
                    if (distance > record) {
                        ways++;
                    }
                }
                totalWays *= ways;
            }
            System.out.println(totalWays);
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, I've changed the condition if (distance >= record) back to if (distance > record) to only consider the ways when the calculated distance is strictly greater than the record. The rest of the code remains the same.
